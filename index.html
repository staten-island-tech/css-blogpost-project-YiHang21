        </h1>

        <p class="text1">
            Potable water comprises only a small fraction of the total use of water in the United States, with the main
            uses of freshwater resources being agricultural (for example, irrigation, animal feeding operations) and
            industrial (for example, cooling towers) activities 1. These activities, in addition to medical ones (for
            example, hemodialysis, dental procedures), are commonly referred to as “other uses” of water.

        <p class="text2">
            When a kangaroo does find itself pursued by a predator, it often flees toward water. This can just be an
            escape strategy, since kangaroos are surprisingly good swimmers (again, thanks to that massive tail). But in
            some cases, the prey might be leading its pursuer into a trap. Once a kangaroo is chest-deep in the water,
            it will sometimes turn around and confront the predator, grabbing it with its forelimbs and attempting to
            drown it.

            This is for all the religious fanatics who, when finding themselves in a tough situation, have a tendency to
            let a swear word or to slip. This phrase helps when tempted to do wrong.
